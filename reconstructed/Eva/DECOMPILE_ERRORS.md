# Decompile Errors / Revisit List — Eva

Per the standing goal (2026-07-27, updated): "Continue decompiling both OA.ko
and EVA until told to stop. Note the decompiled files that error or do not
compile properly, we can revisit later. Only stop once the entirety of OA.ko
and EVA are decompiled."

This file tracks functions/files where a reconstruction attempt hit a real
blocker — compile error, link error, or a transcription that couldn't be
made to match ground truth with reasonable effort — so later passes can
revisit them without re-discovering the same blocker from scratch.

Format: `## <Class::method or file>` + real ground-truth address/size +
what went wrong + what would be needed to unblock it.

Do NOT log routine Tier-B scope deferrals here (a class correctly judged
"needs an unmodeled dependency, precisely documented, no attempt forced") —
those belong in `HARDWARE_REVIEW_LOG.md`'s deferred registry as before. This
file is specifically for attempts that were MADE and failed to compile/link,
or where the reconstruction doesn't match ground truth after a real attempt.
